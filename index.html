      <p>
         The peanut butter and jelly sandwich, affectionately known as PB&J, is a
         quintessential American comfort food. With its perfect balance of nutty richness
         and fruity sweetness, it has become a staple in lunchboxes, picnics, and quick
         meals worldwide. But how did this iconic sandwich come to be?
      </p>

      <h2>The History of PB&J</h2>
      <p>
         The roots of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich can be traced back to the early
         20th century. Peanut butter, which had been introduced at the 1904 World's Fair
         in St. Louis, quickly gained popularity as an affordable and nutritious protein
         source. Meanwhile, fruit preserves, a centuries-old tradition, were commonly used
         to sweeten bread.
      </p>
      <p>
         The first known reference to combining peanut butter and jelly appeared in a 1901
         article in the Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic
         Economics. However, PB&J didn't become a household name until the 1920s and
         1930s, when sliced bread became widely available. During World War II, it gained
         further fame as a favorite among American soldiers, who found it both convenient
         and satisfying.

      <p>
         Making a PB&J sandwich is simple, but a little technique can elevate it to
         perfection.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or your favorite variety)</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter (creamy or crunchy)</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons jelly or jam (grape, strawberry, or your preferred flavor)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <b>Prepare the bread:</b> Lay the two slices of bread flat on a cutting board.
            If you prefer crustless sandwiches, trim the edges with a knife.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Spread the peanut butter:</b> Using a butter knife, spread the peanut
            butter evenly across one slice of bread. Cover the entire surface to ensure
            every bite has the nutty flavor.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Spread the jelly:</b> Clean the knife or use a separate one to spread the
            jelly evenly across the other slice of bread. Adjust the amount based on your
            sweetness preference.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Combine:</b> Place the slice with peanut butter and the slice with jelly
            together, aligning the edges. Press gently to secure.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Serve and enjoy:</b> Cut the sandwich in half (diagonally or straight) for
            easier handling, and serve immediately. Pair it with a glass of milk for the
            ultimate nostalgic meal.
         </li>
      </ol>
